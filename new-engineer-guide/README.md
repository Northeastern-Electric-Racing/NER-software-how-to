[How do I open a pull request](https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/NER-software-how-to/blob/027029c61f5761c446e9e15b17149ff325b0c277/git/pull-requests.md)? 

Work through General Steps and then Local Environment Setup in order.

## General steps 

## Useful terminology

- NER: Northeastern Electric Racing
  - Northeastern's official electric race car building club, building an all-electric Formula One-style race car. NER is a club based in the College of Engineering with opportunities for students to learn business, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering skills.
- PM: Project Management
  - Project management is the practice of organizing the work of a team and lead them to success in a certain period of time.
  - The primary challenge of project management is to achieve all of the project goals within the given constraints of scope, time, quality, and budget.
- Gantt Chart:
  - A timeline view of a project that illustrates the sequence of project phases (often equivalent to work packages) and their durations. 
- WP: Work package
  - A work package is a well-defined unit within a project.
  - Work packages within NER include a unique identifying number (see WBS #).
- CR: Change Request
  - A change request is a request for a change to a specific project or work package. Anyone can submit a change request.
  - Change requests are primarily focused on changes being made to the project's given constraints (see PM).
  - Sufficient documentation is requested to accompany the change request in order to better document changes and offer explanations for the changes.
- WBS#: Work Breakdown Structure Number
  - A work breakdown structure number is a unique identifying number assigned to each element of the work breakdown structure.
  - The WBS # allows easy reference to a project or a specific project component.
- PR: Pull request
  - A request in Gitub to merge a branch into another branch.
  - Typically this involves getting reviewers to approve this request to move it into the master branch.
